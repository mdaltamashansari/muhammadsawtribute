          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>The prophet Muhammad was the founder of the religion of Islam.
          Followers of Islam, called Muslims, believe that Muhammad received
          messages from Allah (God). These messages were later collected into
          the Koran, the holy book of Islam.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>>Muhammad was born in the Arabian town of Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia)
          in about 570. Muhammad’s father died before Muhammad was born, and
          Muhammad’s mother died when he was 6. He was then raised by his
          grandfather and later by his uncle.
         when Muhammad was about 25 years old
          , he married a rich, older woman named Khadijah. Their marriage helped
          Muhammad gain wealth and social standing, and they had six children.
          Although many men at the time had more than one wife, Khadijah was
          Muhammad’s only wife until after her death.</p>
        </li>

          <h2>Beginnings of Islam</h2>
          <p>According to tradition, in about 610 Muhammad had a vision (thought to
          be of the angel Gabriel) and heard a voice tell him, “You are the
          messenger of God.” At various times during the rest of his life,
          Muhammad received verbal messages that he believed came directly from
          God.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Muhammad began preaching in Mecca in about 613.</h2>
          <p>He told people they should worship only one God, which was different
          from the Arab practice of worshipping many gods. He also told people
          to be generous as a way of expressing their appreciation to God. His
          new religion came to be called Islam, meaning “submission to God.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>
            Leaving Mecca Many people in Mecca were against the new religion.
          </h2>
          <p>Those who believed in several gods were afraid that their holy places
          might be destroyed. Merchants disliked Muhammad because he criticized
          them for being greedy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>
            Muhammad worried that his enemies might hurt him and his followers,
          </h2>
          <p>so he encouraged his followers to move to the nearby city of Medina.
          Muhammad himself reached Medina on September 24, 622, which is
          considered the starting date for the history of Islam. Muhammad’s trip
          to Medina is known as the Hegira.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Uniting the Tribes</h2>
          <p>Most Arabs at the time were part of large groups called tribes.
          Muhammad was determined to join the many Arab tribes together under
          Islam. He hoped that by uniting they could use their military strength
          to spread Islam to other areas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>To achieve his goal</h2>
          <p>Muhammad had to get the support of Mecca. From 622 on, he and his
          followers fought several battles with forces from Mecca. By the time
          Muhammad and his forces entered Mecca in 630, many notable citizens
          had already moved to Medina to become Muslims. Mecca gave up with
          little fight. </p>
